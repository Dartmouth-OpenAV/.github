## Welcome to Dartmouth OpenAV👋

OpenAV is an audiovisual control system developed at Dartmouth College in 2019. It features a graphical touch interface for managing AV equipment in classrooms, conference rooms, and huddle spaces. The system supports a wide range of AV components, including projectors, flat panel displays, video switchers, projection screens, DSPs, microphones, speakers, and cameras. Integrated Zoom Rooms provide seamless video conferencing, while additional solutions include Lecture Capture for room recording and a conference room scheduler for displaying room availability.

Taking an IT-driven approach to AV, OpenAV uses configuration files to manage system setups. Communication with AV devices is handled via TCP/IP, and control interfaces are built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whenever possible, Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) is utilized for both power and control. The project also includes a web-based dashboard for system monitoring.
